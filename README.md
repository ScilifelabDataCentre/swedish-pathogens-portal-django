# Swedish Pathogens Portal

***WIP repository for Swedish Pathogens Portal 2.0***

The Swedish Pathogens Portal is being rebuilt as a Django-based web application.

The source code for the current (live) Swedish Pathogens Portal can be found in the [pathogens-portal repository](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/pathogens-portal).

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Template Engine**: Django templates
- **CSS Framework**: TailwindCSS
- **JavaScript**: htmx
- **Package Manager**: uv
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.13+ (for local development)
- uv (for local development)
- git

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

Open a terminal window, go to the directory where you want to clone the repository and run

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ScilifelabDataCentre/swedish-pathogens-portal.git
```

**NOTE:** The sections below assume you are in the project's root

### 2. Create a `.env` file

For local development, you can copy `.env.example`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Enable pre-commit hooks

This project uses **[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)** to run Ruff linting and formatting before each commit.

> ℹ️ The following commands only need to be run once per developer.

**Install development dependencies (including `pre-commit` and `ruff`):**

```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

**Enable the Git hook:**

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

After this, `pre-commit` will always expect a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. The hooks defined in that config file will be run every time `git commit` is executed. The commit will fail if the hook finds any issues that need to be solved.

> ℹ️ To uninstall / disable the pre-commit hooks, run:
>
> ```bash
> uv run pre-commit uninstall
> ```

**(*Optional*) Manually run pre-commit hooks on all files:**

Pre-commit hooks are automatically run on every commit, but only on changed files in the checked out branch. To run the hooks on all files in the repository:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

> 💡 Alternative (pip instead of uv):
>
> ```bash
> pip install pre-commit      # Install
> pre-commit install          # Enable 
> pre-commit run --all-files  # Run checks
> pre-commit uninstall        # Disable
> ```

### 4. Start the application

```bash
docker compose up
```

> ℹ️ Alternative to Docker: Devbox config files are available upon request.

After the application starts, open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Development / Contributing

### Running tests (WIP)

***WIP***

### Running migrations

To apply database changes, run Django migrations:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### Making migrations

For new apps and models, you may need to create migration files first.

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations
```

### Modifying dependencies (uv)

While developing, you can add or remove a dependency by running:

```bash
docker compose exec web uv <add/remove> <package_name>
```

To add or remove a development dependency:

```bash
docker compose exec web uv <add/remove> --group dev <package_name>
```

### Creating a new app

To create a new app (section), first create a directory with the desired app/section name.

```bash
docker compose exec web mkdir pages/<app_name>
```

Then use Django's utility command to create an app and the required files.

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py startapp <app_name> pages/<app_name>
```

After creating the app, complete the following steps:

- Add `pages.<app_name>` to `core/settings/base.py` *installed_apps* list
- Rename the app name to `pages.<app_name>` in `pages/<app_name>/app.py`
- Create a `pages/<app_name>/urls.py` file for the app's URLs
- Include the app's URLs in `core/urls.py` (like other apps)
- If needed, create `templates/<app_name>` directory within the app directory for templates
- If needed, create `static/<app_name>` directory within the app directory for static files

### Clearing old containers/images

If you need to reset your Docker environment and start fresh, you can remove the containers and images:

```bash
docker compose down --rmi
```
