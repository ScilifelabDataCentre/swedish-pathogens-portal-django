"""Contact form definitions and anti-spam validation.

This module defines the `ContactForm` used by the contact page. It includes
layered, user-transparent anti-spam checks (honeypot, submission timing, and
double-submit cookie) and content validation.

The form accepts `request` in its constructor to access cookies for the
double-submit verification.
